This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)


## Released

### 6.0.0

**Breaking Change**
 * There are breaking changes in functionalities like form validation validation which can be referred from [Migration Guide](https://gitlab.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/Apollo/afx-next-react/-/wikis/Migration-Guide).

**3rd Party Updates**
- NodeJs upgraded to v16. 
  * With node 16, npm version is also updated to 8.x. When you run npm install` npm 7 onwards, it now automatically installs peer dependencies mentioned in the package.json files of the libraries. This can cause error during npm install. To workaround this issue, node has provided legacy-peer-deps options which can be passed to npm install. This will fallback to old behaviour where peer dependencies wont be installed. For more information visit [legacy-peer-deps](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/config#legacy-peer-deps).  
  There are two ways to enable legacy-peer-deps option:
    1. Pass this option to npm install command like npm install --legacy-peer-deps.
    2. Add this option to .npmrc file.  

  * UnhandledPromiseRejections will be treated as Errors and will cause the node process to terminate.

**Enhancements**
- Images lazy load
  * To improve data download, we have implemented on demand loading of SVG Images.
  * Support to import SVG image via ES6 import is provided. SVG image can be imported as a Component or String.
  * The on demand loading of svgs might increase the network chattiness for applications that use large number of svg images. To mitigate this, a configuration point to bundle multiple SVG images together in kit.json.  

### 5.1.0

**3rd Party Updates**
- htmltojsx removal
  * Removed htmltojsx as it was using **ua-parser-js** (had Malicious Releases Vulnerability) and **json-schema** (had Remote Prototype Pollution Vulnerability).

### 5.0.0

**Breaking Change**
 * This release is after migrating the underlying technology from AngularJs to React.js. 
 * There are multiple breaking changes which can be referred to from [Migration Guide](https://gitlab.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/Apollo/afx-next-react/-/wikis/Migration-Guide).
